# Mapping extreme heat trends in California
Code to visualize above threshold temperature days in each California county (by county seat) historically and under climate change.
Absolute number of above threshold days and rate of change should impact planning adaption to climate change, and thus counties were clustered by typologies according to these "metrics."
Existence of climate action plans (or similar) appear not to correlate with typology.

Practicing data processing & visualization, machine learning libraries, exploring Cal-Adapt data.
